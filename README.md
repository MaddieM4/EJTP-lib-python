EJTP-lib-python
===============

Encrypted JSON Transport Protocol library for Python 2.x.

EJTP is a data transfer protocol that allows JSON exchange over a
very wide and infinitely extensible set of underlying transports.
UDP, TCP, IRC, email, XMPP, HTTP, Telnet, Carrier pigeons, web
forums, Twitter, Socket.IO... almost any protocol you could name
can be engineered to carry EJTP frames.


Installation
============

Download, clone, or transmodulate the source code to your computer,
go into the uncompressed directory, and run "./setup.py install" as
an administrator account. This is standard procedure for most
Python libraries, and is how this one works as well.


Usage
=====

This library is still in the process of being ripped out of the
[ConcurrenTree](https://github.com/campadrenalin/ConcurrenTree) MCP
library, and as such, is not usable yet. It may be awhile. I'll take
out this notice and replace it with something more helpful when it's
ready.
