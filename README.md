===============

Encrypted JSON Transport Protocol library for Python 2.x.

EJTP is a data transfer protocol that allows JSON exchange over a
very wide and infinitely extensible set of underlying transports.
UDP, TCP, IRC, email, XMPP, HTTP, Telnet, Carrier pigeons, web
forums, Twitter, Socket.IO... almost any protocol you could name
can be engineered to carry EJTP frames.
